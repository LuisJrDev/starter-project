# Firebase Firestore Backend
In this folder are all the [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) related files. 
You will use this folder to add the schema of the *Articles* you want to upload for the app and to add the rules that enforce this schema. 

## DB Schema
The full schema (Firestore collection `articles` and Cloud Storage folder `media/articles`) is documented in [docs/DB_SCHEMA.md](./docs/DB_SCHEMA.md).

## Getting Started
Before starting to work on the backend, you must have a Firebase project with the [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Firebase Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) and [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) technologies enabled.
To do this, create a project but enable only Firebase Cloud Storage, Firebase Firestore, and Firebase Local Emulator Suite technologies.

### Production requirements for Cloud Storage
These two steps are not needed for the emulators, only for a real Firebase project:

1. **Blaze plan.** Default buckets (`{projectId}.firebasestorage.app`) are only accessible on
   the pay-as-you-go Blaze plan. A project on the free Spark plan gets `storage/unauthorized` on
   every upload, even with correct rules. Blaze keeps the same no-cost quotas, so this project
   costs nothing at its scale. Set a budget alert anyway (it notifies, it does not cap spending).
2. **Cross-service rules permission.** `storage.rules` calls `firestore.exists(...)` to protect
   published thumbnails, which requires the Storage service agent
   `service-{projectNumber}@gcp-sa-firebasestorage.iam.gserviceaccount.com` to have the role
   *Firebase Rules Firestore Service Agent*. Accept the prompt shown by the Firebase console
   (Storage → Rules) or by an interactive `firebase deploy`. The CLI skips that prompt when it
   runs non-interactively. The change may take a few minutes to propagate, and until then
   uploads also fail with `storage/unauthorized`.


## Deploying the Project
In order to deploy the Firestore rules from this repository to the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/)  of your project, follow these steps:

### 1. Install firebase CLI
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
### 2. Login to your account
```
firebase login
```

### 3. Add your project id to the .firebasesrc file 
This corresponds to the project Id of the firebase project you created in the Firebase web-app.
[Change project id](.firebaserc)

### 4. Initialize the project
```
firebase init
```

You should leave everything as it is, choose:
- emulators
- firestore
- cloud storage

### 5. Deploy to firebase
```
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
```
This will deploy all the rules you write in `firestore.rules` to your Firebase Firestore project.
Be careful becasuse it will overwrite the existing firestore.rules file of your project.

## Running the project in a local emulator
To run the application locally, use the following command:

```firebase emulators:start```

## Seeding sample articles
`scripts/seed.mjs` publishes the sample articles in `scripts/seed-data/` following the
publishing flow described in the [schema](./docs/DB_SCHEMA.md#publishing-flow): it uploads each
thumbnail to `media/articles/{articleId}.{ext}` and then writes `articles/{articleId}`.
It uses the Firebase **client** SDK, so every write is checked by the security rules, just like
the app's writes.

```
npm install
firebase emulators:start --only firestore,storage   # shell 1
npm run seed:emulator                               # shell 2
```

Open the Emulator UI (http://127.0.0.1:4000) to browse the seeded documents and images.

In emulator mode the thumbnail URLs are stored with host `10.0.2.2`, which is how the Android
emulator reaches your machine. For a physical device using `adb reverse`, seed with
`EMULATOR_THUMBNAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1 npm run seed:emulator`.

To seed the real project, deploy the rules first and then run `npm run seed:production`.
It uses the `news-backend-scripts` Web app of the Firebase project.

## Testing the security rules
`test/` contains the unit tests of `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules`
([@firebase/rules-unit-testing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/unit-tests) + the
built-in `node:test` runner). There is one or more tests for every constraint in the
[schema](./docs/DB_SCHEMA.md), including the edge cases (exact limits, emoji lengths, forged
timestamps, foreign thumbnail URLs, overwrites, orphan cleanup).

```
npm install
npm run emulators      # shell 1
npm run test:rules     # shell 2
```
Or in a single command, as the CI does (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
```
npx firebase-tools@15 emulators:exec --only firestore,storage "npm run test:rules"
```
(The standalone `firebase` binary cannot run ES module scripts inside `emulators:exec`, while the
npm package can.)

## Security

### Why Firebase API keys are committed
`frontend/lib/firebase_options.dart`, `frontend/android/app/google-services.json` and
`scripts/seed.mjs` contain the Firebase client configuration, API keys included. GitHub secret
scanning reports them as "Google API Key".

They are **not secrets**. A Firebase API key only identifies the project, and it has to ship inside
every build of the app, so anyone can extract it from the APK
([Firebase: API keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys)). Hiding, rotating or
removing it from the git history would therefore protect nothing. The project is protected by the
measures below.

### How the project is protected
1. **Security rules are the access control.** `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` enforce the
   [schema](./docs/DB_SCHEMA.md): documents can only be created, never updated or deleted; lists
   are limited to 50 documents; thumbnails must be images of up to 5 MB, can never be overwritten,
   and can only be deleted while orphaned. 66 unit tests cover them and run in CI on every push.
   They were also verified in production with forbidden requests (edit, delete, overwrite, list
   without a limit), which all returned `403`.
2. **The API keys are restricted to Firebase APIs.** On a pay-as-you-go (Blaze) project an
   unrestricted key could be billed for other Google APIs called with it. The *Android key* and
   *Browser key* that Firebase creates are restricted by default to the Firebase APIs (25 APIs in
   this project, checked in
   [Google Cloud → APIs & Services → Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)).
   Keep that restriction when creating a new project. There is no Android app (SHA-1) restriction
   on purpose: every developer or reviewer building a debug APK signs it with a different
   certificate.
3. **Budget alert** on the billing account. It only notifies, it does not cap spending.
4. **Tests never touch production.** The integration test refuses to run without the emulator
   flag, and the seed script targets the emulator unless `--target=production` is given.

### Known limitations and next steps
- **Anyone with the app can publish.** Articles are validated by the rules, but there is no
  authentication yet. The next steps are
  [App Check](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check) (Play Integrity) enforced on Firestore
  and Storage to reject clients that are not the genuine app, then Firebase Authentication with an
  `authorId` and owner-only edit/delete rules (see [Future evolution](./docs/DB_SCHEMA.md#future-evolution)).
- **Orphaned thumbnails** remain if both the article write and the cleanup fail. A scheduled Cloud
  Function could remove images that no article references.
